given YOUR-PROJECT

I have used two versions:

A) PYTHON: only to insert 200 docs of 3800 chars in Index "1001_Nights"

	1) app.yaml  :  set application: YOUR-PROJECT
	
	2) deploy python-docs-insertion executing the following command from within python-docs-insertion folder:
		"appcfg.py update ."
	
	3) then insert 200 docs of 3800 chars into "1001_Nights" Index visiting:
		
		http:// python-docs-insertion.YOUR-PROJECT.appspot.com/search/insert 
		
		3.1) you can clear this index visiting:
			http://python-docs-insertion.YOUR-PROJECT.appspot.com/search/clear

B) JAVA: 
	
	1) java-search/pom.xml  :  set <my.cloud.sdk.folder> 
	
	2) java-search/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml : set <application> to YOUR-PROJECT

	3) deploy java-search executing the following command from within java-search folder:
		"mvn gcloud:deploy"

	4) two ways to do search:
		4.1) java-search.YOUR-PROJECT.appspot.com/user trying to mimic user's code
		4.2) java-search.YOUR-PROJECT.appspot.com/asbadaspossible to try to make it as slow as he reports
